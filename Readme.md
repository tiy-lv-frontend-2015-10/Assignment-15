___This homework is due by 8am, on 11/03/2015___

## Objectives

- Ability to understand the role Constructors play in JavaScript.
- Be able to create flexible functions that can serve a variety of data

## Normal Mode

1. Fork & Clone this repo.
2. You'll be ONLY adding code to the (`constructors`) area of the `constructors.js`, leave the rest of the code alone
3. Your goal is to make sure all of the tests pass
4. To see what that looks like, refer to the `final.png` screenshot below:

![Passing Tests](./final.png "Passing Tests")

## Deliverables

1. Push to github (origin/master)
2. Deploy to github pages 
3. Post a link in your pull request comments to the github pages site.

I would like to clarify the differences in how a ternary works (if , else statement is easy), but the way we got this to work actually assigns a value. Please go over this with me... and there are others who would like to hear this as well.

Thank You!
